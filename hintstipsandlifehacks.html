                    <p>KEEP COMMUNICATION OPEN.
                        It's vital you let you girls know that they can come to you about anything.
                        Whether its a simple conversation, or if you start communicating via a journal style system, it
                        all
                        depends on what makes your little ones tick.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>BOOST YOUR CHILDS CONFIDENCE.
                        With the constant pressures of social media, young girls, as well as boys, are constantly
                        comparing
                        themselves to their peers. Boost her confidence, build a positive body image, and help her
                        through
                        those phases, especially that of puberty when her body undergoes major changes. Be a strong role
                        model and applaud your daughter on her strengths.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>LET GO A LITTLE.
                        It is natural for fathers to be slightly overprotective of their little daughter, but trying to
                        be
                        more protective only leads to friction and rebellion. Let your daughter have her space and
                        respect
                        her need for privacy, while building a bond of mutual trust and dependability.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>AN HONEST APPROACH.
                        It isn’t easy to address issues of hormonal and emotional metamorphoses that girls go through
                        but an
                        honest, easy going approach is possibly the best way to go. Talk to her about her physical and
                        emotional discomfort that certain phases of her life might bring, and be honest about discussing
                        the
                        why and how of it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>GOOD LISTENING SKILLS.
                        It’s important to find time to talk and listen to each other. Be open to talking about all
                        emotions,
                        including anger, frustration, and anxiety, and pay attention to your child’s body language for
                        nonverbal messages. By listening to them, you’re showing that they’re worthy of your attention,
                        their views and feelings are valid, and that you trust their ability to solve problems.</p>

                    <p>
                        It’s pretty obvious to most, if not all people that going through a break up with children
                        involved
                        is
                        VERY hard. No matter the circumstances. It’s very easy to get sidetracked and have your
                        attention
                        moved
                        away from the things that really matter at that time.
                        Here’s a short guide to help anyone going through the same thing, understand or know what expect
                        in
                        the
                        future.

                        At first, many people will say to you, and whilst this is totally correct, you must NOT forget
                        about
                        your own mental state. Try to treat yourself too, as well as your kids. See friends, go
                        shopping, go
                        to
                        the pub, go for a run, gym. Find yourself a space that allows you to be you.

                        Each living situation is very different, some people have family for help, some
                        don’t.
                        this
                        is obviously a huge issue, take a look at our ‘links and pages’ section for advice.

                        Everyone wants to protect their children from the rough situation of a break up. Which is great,
                        but
                        sometimes its taken too far. Talk to your kids, explain why you're not together, explain what
                        will
                        happen
                        and reassure them that you are going nowhere. Keep open communication at all times.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Find your own form of childcare, for your peace of mind, knowing you always have a back up plan
                        in
                        case of emergencies.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        No matter how many hours you agree to have your kids for, its VITAL that when you are with them,
                        you
                        are WITH them. Give them your all, time and energy.

                    <p>
                        Lastly, a reminder of what all children want and desire. YOU!!!! All they want is to play with
                        their
                        daddy, to be cuddled by their daddy, and to feel safe with their daddy.

                        Kids don’t come cheap – we all know that! The older they get, the more they need and the costs
                        soon
                        mount up.

                        Whether you share childcare with your ex-partner or you’re the sole care provider, you may be
                        entitled
                        to single parent benefits to help manage the costs of bringing up your children.

                        The single parent benefits you’re eligible for will depend on several factors, including your
                        employment
                        and financial circumstances, and whether or not your children live with you all or most of the

                        Universal credit for single dads
                        If you’re a single dad who is looking for work or on a low income, you may be able to claim
                        Universal
                        Credit to help you cover the costs of housing, looking after your children and childcare.

                        In many areas of the UK, Universal Credit has replaced several other legacy benefits including
                        Income
                        Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-based Employment and Support Allowance,
                        Child
                        Tax
                        Credit, Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. This means, if you’re making a new claim, it’ll
                        likely
                        be for Universal Credit, rather than the separate legacy benefits.

                        If you are already receiving any of the legacy benefits mentioned above and you have recently
                        become
                        a
                        single dad, you will need to notify HMRC about your change of circumstances. They will review
                        your
                        benefit entitlement and are likely to switch you to Universal Credit, assessing you as either a
                        single
                        person or lone parent.
                    </p>

                        Working single parent benefits
                        Previously, if you worked at least 16 hours a week but were on a low income, you may have
                        claimed
                        Working Tax Credits. This has now changed to Universal Credit.

                        With Universal Credit, there are no limits on how many hours a week you can work in order to
                        receive
                        it.
                        All they’ll do is gradually reduce your Universal Credit payments, as you earn more money. You
                        won’t
                        suddenly be left completely out of pocket. If you’re looking for flexible work around your role
                        as a
                        single dad, take a look at our job listings.

                        Some single dads may also be entitled to work allowance if they are responsible for dependent
                        children
                        and/or cannot work as many hours because of an illness or disability.

                        It’s worth remembering that benefits are not just for unemployed single parents. A single parent
                        working
                        full time may still be entitled to financial support, like Universal Credit. Check to see if you
                        can
                        make a claim.

                        As a single dad, you may also qualify for a single person’s discount on your Council Tax bill if
                        there
                        are no other adults in your household. Contact your local council to apply.

                        Single parent child benefit
                        Child benefit is paid to parents with dependent children, until the 31st August following your
                        child’s
                        16th birthday or until the age of 20 if they’re in full-time education. Child benefit is
                        tax-free
                        unless
                        you earn more than £50,000.

                        Currently, child benefit is £20.70 per week for your first child and £13.70 per week for other
                        children.

                        Bear in mind that child benefit can only be paid to one parent. This should be the main carer
                        i.e.
                        the
                        parent the child or children usually live with.

                        If you are a single dad and the main carer for your children, you will be entitled to receive
                        child
                        benefit. If your ex-partner is currently receiving Child Benefit, they can pass it to you
                        voluntarily.
                        If this isn’t possible, you will need to report a change of circumstances to the Child Benefit
                        Office
                        and see if it can be passed to you.

                <div>

                        How much does a single parent get on benefits?
                        The amount you receive in single parent benefits will depend on your personal circumstances. You
                        may
                        be
                        entitled to some benefits but not others.

                        Universal Credit is made up of a basic allowance, plus additional money for things like housing
                        costs,
                        children costs and disability costs. So if you are a single dad and the main carer for your
                        children,
                        it’s likely you will receive additional Universal Credit. If you are also on a low income and
                        need
                        help
                        paying for your rent or mortgage, you are likely to qualify for the housing element too.

                        The amount of Universal Credit you receive will vary depending on the income you receive from
                        working, a
                        pension, other benefits or savings and capital.

                        Reagents and equip­ment:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PVA glue (200 ml);</li>
                        <li>Kid's poster paint (amount desired, can use colouring but tends to leave stains);</li>
                        <li>Contact lense solution/saline solution (20/40ml);</li>
                        <li>Shaving foam (100g);</li>
                        <li>Random soaps, gels, lotions and creams;</li>
                        <li>Baking powder (5g);</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    Method:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Mix PVA glue with your choice of color.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gradually add the saline solution 1 teaspoon at a time while mixing until the slime is
                            coming
                            away from the sides of the bowl.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you have your base slime you can then start to experiment with all the different types
                            of
                            creams lotions and foams yopu have around the house. Shaving foam is great. If you have the
                            patience for cleaning after, glitter is also great and kids love it.
                        </li>
