                <li>
                    KEEP COMMUNICATION OPEN.
                    It's vital you let you girls know that they can come to you about anything.
                    wether its a simple conversation, or if you start communicating via a journal style system, it all
                    depends on what makes your little ones tick.

                <li>
                    BOOST YOUR CHILDS CONFIDENCE.
                    With the constant pressures of social media, young girls, as well as boys, are constantly comparing
                    themselves to their peers. Boost her confidence, build a positive body image, and help her through
                    those phases, especially that of puberty when her body undergoes major changes. Be a strong role
                    model and applaud your daughter on her strengths.

                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    LET GO A LITTLE.
                    It is natural for fathers to be slightly overprotective of their little daughter, but trying to be
                    more protective only leads to friction and rebellion. Let your daughter have her space and respect
                    her need for privacy, while building a bond of mutual trust and dependability.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    AN HONEST APPROACH.
                    It isn’t easy to address issues of hormonal and emotional metamorphoses that girls go through but an
                    honest, easy going approach is possibly the best way to go. Talk to her about her physical and
                    emotional discomfort that certain phases of her life might bring, and be honest about discussing the
                    why and how of it.

                <br>

                <li>
                    GOOD LISTENING SKILLS.
                    It’s important to find time to talk and listen to each other. Be open to talking about all emotions,
                    including anger, frustration, and anxiety, and pay attention to your child’s body language for
                    nonverbal messages. By listening to them, you’re showing that they’re worthy of your attention,
                    their views and feelings are valid, and that you trust their ability to solve problems.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                It’s pretty obvious to most, if not all people that going through a break up with children involved is
                VERY hard. No matter the circumstances. It’s very easy to get sidetracked and have your attention moved
                away from the things that really matter at that time.
                Here’s a short guide to help anyone going through the same thing, understand or know what expect in the
                future.
                <ul>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                <li>
                At first, many people will say to you, and whilst this is totally correct, you must NOT forget about
                your own mental state. Try to treat yourself too, as well as your kids. See friends, go shopping, go to
                the pub, go for a run, gym. Find yourself a space that allows you to be you.
                 </li>

                <li>
                Living situation, each situation is very different, some people have family for help, some don’t. this
                is obviously a huge issue, take a look at our ‘links and pages’ section for advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                Everyone wants to protect their children from the rough situation of a break up. Which is great, but
                sometimes its taken too far. Talk to your kids, explain why your not together, explain what will happen
                and reassure them that you are going nowhere. Keep open communication at all times.
                </li>
                <li>
                Find your own form of childcare, for your peace of mind, knowing you always have a back up plan in
                case of emergencies.
                </li>
                <li>
                No matter how many hours you agree to have your kids for, its VITAL that when you are with them, you
                are WITH them. Give them your all, time and energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                Lastly, a reminder of what all children want and desire. YOU!!!! All they want is to play with their
                daddy, to be cuddled by their daddy, and to feel safe with their daddy.
                </li>

                </ul>

        <label for="title4">What Benefits Can I Get As a Single Parent? (the boring money bit)</label>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
            <ul>


                <li>Kids don’t come cheap – we all know that! The older they get, the more they need and the costs soon
                    mount up.

                    Whether you share childcare with your ex-partner or you’re the sole care provider, you may be
                    entitled
                    to single parent benefits to help manage the costs of bringing up your children.

                    The single parent benefits you’re eligible for will depend on several factors, including your
                    employment
                    and financial circumstances, and whether or not your children live with you all or most of the time.

                <li>
                    Universal credit for single dads
                    If you’re a single dad who is looking for work or on a low income, you may be able to claim
                    Universal
                    Credit to help you cover the costs of housing, looking after your children and childcare.

                    In many areas of the UK, Universal Credit has replaced several other legacy benefits including
                    Income
                    Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-based Employment and Support Allowance, Child
                    Tax
                    Credit, Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. This means, if you’re making a new claim, it’ll
                    likely
                    be for Universal Credit, rather than the separate legacy benefits.

                    If you are already receiving any of the legacy benefits mentioned above and you have recently become
                    a
                    single dad, you will need to notify HMRC about your change of circumstances. They will review your
                    benefit entitlement and are likely to switch you to Universal Credit, assessing you as either a
                    single
                    person or lone parent.

                    You’ll need to submit your application for Universal Credit online.
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>Working single parent benefits
                    Previously, if you worked at least 16 hours a week but were on a low income, you may have claimed
                    Working Tax Credits. This has now changed to Universal Credit.

                    With Universal Credit, there are no limits on how many hours a week you can work in order to receive
                    it.
                    All they’ll do is gradually reduce your Universal Credit payments, as you earn more money. You won’t
                    suddenly be left completely out of pocket. If you’re looking for flexible work around your role as a
                    single dad, take a look at our job listings.

                    Some single dads may also be entitled to work allowance if they are responsible for dependent
                    children
                    and/or cannot work as many hours because of an illness or disability.

                    It’s worth remembering that benefits are not just for unemployed single parents. A single parent
                    working
                    full time may still be entitled to financial support, like Universal Credit. Check to see if you can
                    make a claim.

                    As a single dad, you may also qualify for a single person’s discount on your Council Tax bill if
                    there
                    are no other adults in your household. Contact your local council to apply.
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>Single parent child benefit
                    Child benefit is paid to parents with dependent children, until the 31st August following your
                    child’s
                    16th birthday or until the age of 20 if they’re in full-time education. Child benefit is tax-free
                    unless
                    you earn more than £50,000.

                    Currently, child benefit is £20.70 per week for your first child and £13.70 per week for other
                    children.

                    Bear in mind that child benefit can only be paid to one parent. This should be the main carer i.e.
                    the
                    parent the child or children usually live with.

                    If you are a single dad and the main carer for your children, you will be entitled to receive child
                    benefit. If your ex-partner is currently receiving Child Benefit, they can pass it to you
                    voluntarily.
                    If this isn’t possible, you will need to report a change of circumstances to the Child Benefit
                    Office
                    and see if it can be passed to you.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    How much does a single parent get on benefits?
                    The amount you receive in single parent benefits will depend on your personal circumstances. You may
                    be
                    entitled to some benefits but not others.

                    Universal Credit is made up of a basic allowance, plus additional money for things like housing
                    costs,
                    children costs and disability costs. So if you are a single dad and the main carer for your
                    children,
                    it’s likely you will receive additional Universal Credit. If you are also on a low income and need
                    help
                    paying for your rent or mortgage, you are likely to qualify for the housing element too.

                    The amount of Universal Credit you receive will vary depending on the income you receive from
                    working, a
                    pension, other benefits or savings and capital.

                        Gradually add the saline solution 1 teaspoon at a time while mixing until the slime is coming
